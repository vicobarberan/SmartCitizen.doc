### Adding a Smart Citizen Kit

![Smart Citizen kit 1.1](img/sck_1.1_3.jpg)

*Welcome aboard!* The Smart Citizen Team wants to thank you for being here, for purchasing a kit, and for joining the community taking part in this adventure.

To join the *Smart Citizen family*, we're going to walk you through the steps to add your Smart Citizen Kit to the platform, we'll refer to the Smart Citizen Kit as the *SCK* for now on.

*SIGN UP*

First, go to <a href="https://smartcitizen.me/" target="_blank">smartcitizen.me</a> using your web browser, currently only Google Chrome is supported for the SCK configuration process. Click in **Go to the platform** and then **Sign up** on the upper right menu. Complete the required fields, accept the *[Terms of use and privacy](https://smartcitizen.me/privacy)* and click the **Sign up** button.

Required Fields:

- **Username** - Pick any name you want as long as someone else isn't already using the it.

- **Email** - Enter your email address.

- **Password** - Must be at least 6 characters.

You are now registered, you will receive an email notification. You will be able to complete your user details  later on your [profile page](https://smartcitizen.me/profile/users).

*ADD YOUR SMART CITIZEN KIT*

On the upper right menu click on **Log in** and write the access credentials you just choose. Go on your user icon on the upper right corner and click [Profile](https://smartcitizen.me/profile/kits). On your kit's profile page click on [Add a new kit](https://smartcitizen.me/kits/new).

Please, provide basic information about your kit so others can understand better how you set it up and how you plan to use it.

 - **Title** - Give your SCK a name. This title will be associated with your SCK data.

 - **Exposure** - The SCK is designed to work outdoors but maybe you like to test it indoors first. Choose INDOOR or OUTDOOR to help others understand the data you will provide. 

 - **Kit location** - Please, let us locate you, later you can adjust the location by dragging the marker on the map.

 - **Kit tags** - We suggest you to add tags to help other find your kit. Choose from the available tags or submit a tag request on the [Forum](http://forum.smartcitizen.me).

 - **Description** - This is an optional field that helps  others understand the data you provide.  Why is it for? Is this part of any kind of project? Information like "outdoors in my balcony facing the road" or "in my garden under a tree" could help others understand why some of your data looks the way it does.

Click on the **Next** button, you are close to the end.

*SETUP YOUR SMART CITIZEN KIT*

In order to have your kit connected to the Smart Citizen platform, we need a few step involving the connexion of your kit to your computer. This tool will help you register your kit to the platform, setup your kit's Wi-Fi settings and update its firmware. Currently we support Google Chrome in Win, Mac and Linux.

*If you are on Windows check first [How to install the drivers on Windows?](#/start/how-to-install-the-drivers-on-windows) section for more information.* 

Click on the *ADD TO CHROME* button and wait for the extension to install. 

![Sck Chrome App](img/sck_app_chrome.png)

Finally its time to unpack your SCK. Connect the micro USB cable to your SCK and your computer and turn on the SCK switch on the upper left corner. 

On the dropdown menu you should select the port your SCK is connected. 

*On Mac and Linux the port will be named Smartcitizen or something like /dev/ttyACM0. On Windows this is likely to be COM3 or higher (COM1 and COM2 are usually reserved for hardware serial ports). To find out, you can disconnect your SCK and check the dropdown; the entry that disappears should be the SCK board. Reconnect the board and select that serial port.*

*If you have any issue check your kit is properly connected, switched ON and you do not have the Arduino IDE or other software that uses the serial port open. We recommend you to switch your kit OFF and ON in order to reset the kit before you start.*

Now just click **Start process** in order to start configuring your kit. 

The configurator will try to determine your hardware and firmware version, if your **firmware version is below 0.9.3** you need to update the firmware in order to continue with the process.

![Old firmware](img/conf1.jpg)

If the configurator can't communicate with your board it will report an **Unrecognized board**, we recommend you to try a couple of times, disconnecting your kit, reloading the page and connecting it again to make sure that this is not just a serial port communication problem. 

If the configurator still can't communicate with your kit it may be a firmware/hardware problem. You may try to install the firmware and see if this solves the problem.

![Unrecognized board](img/conf2.jpg)

If you **can't upload the firmware** please refer to the [Firmware update problem](#/start/firmware-update-problem) section or try doing a [Manual set up.](#/start/manual-set-up-the-compilation-way)

After firmware is installed/updated we can continue with Wi-Fi settings.

![Wifi settings](img/conf3.jpg)

*You can add up to 5 different Wi-Fi credentials in your kit. This will allow your kit to connect to multiple networks in case one fails or you will like to move in between to places*

You should complete the fields with your router or access point information:

*At home you should find all the requested information below your home fiber or DSL router on schools and companies you can contact your IT team*

 - **SSID** - This is your Wifi network's name, for example: _My Home Wifi_. 
 
 - **Phrase** - This is your Wi-Fi _password_, you will usually find it written under your router or you can contact your IT team. If your Wi-Fi doesn't have a password just leave it empty and select _Open Wi-Fi network_ on the _Encryption_ dropdown. 
 
*Take care the SSID and Phrase can't be longer than 19 characters and they can't contain the `$` symbol.*
 
 - **Encryption** -  _Optional_  You can leave it to _WPA2_ this is the default for most modern networks. 

 - **External Antenna** - _Optional_ Is your SCK quite far away from Wi-Fi access point? You can use an external antenna with your SCK. Check the [How to use an external antenna?](#/start/how-i-can-extend-the-wi-fi-range) )

Next step is optional, you can set your SCK update interval to optimize the battery performance and sensor resolution ratio.

![Udate interval](img/conf4.jpg)

*By default your SCK will take a reading every minute and post it on-line*

 - **Reading interval** - This defines every how much time your SCK sensors will take a reading and record it. You can set it from 1 minute to an hour.
  
 - **Number posts** - This defines every how much sensor readings your SCK will publish the reading on-line. You can set it from 1 to 20.

Now is time to record the settings on your SCK, just click on **Sync Settings** and wait for a moment. 

*If there is any issue during the process this will be displayed on the **Message window** above. I f you need help please contact [support@smartcitizen.me](mailto:support@smartcitizen.me) *

Last but now least you will see your SCK *Mac Address* registered below this is the ID of your SCK. Just click on **Save** and wait for your kit to publish. **Done!**

*You might need to wait up to 2 minutes or more if you changed the time update settings and refresh your browser in order to see your SCK first post in your device page.*

 **Did you registered your SCK before or did your SCK belong to someone else before?** *Take care your SCK can be registered once at a time, in case you registered before check [How to unlink your SCK?](#/start/how-do-i-register-again-my-sck) or contact [support@smartcitizen.me](mailto:support@smartcitizen.me) .*
 
*Please, if your kit is not publishing properly contact [support@smartcitizen.me](mailto:support@smartcitizen.me) or ask for help in the [forum](http://forum.smartcitizen.me/) .*

### Manual set up: The Serial Way 

In this tutorial aimed to advanced users you will configure your SCK using serial communication. By using serial communication, you will register your Wi-Fi settings into the SCK and save the SCK’s MAC address in our server.
 
The SCK, like most Arduino chips, has the ability to communicate through serial protocol (when plugged with a proper USB cable). The SCK uses the WiFly module to communicate with your Wi-Fi router. Anyway, through serial communication you will be able to send the commands directly with this module to set your Wi-Fi settings and extract the MAC address used by our server to verify your identity.
 
Note that this tutorial works for both SCK v1.0 (from the Goteo crowdfunding campaign) and SCK v1.1 (from the KickStarter crowdfunding campaign), independently of the firmware version used.
 

#### STEP 1: Configuring the Wi-Fi settings

- Open Arduino IDE.
- Connect your SCK via USB.
- From the Tools > Board menu, choose the right USB port (generally the last one).
- From the Tools > Serial port menu, select the right board. This is Leonardo for SCK v1.0 (Goteo) or LilyPad Arduino USB for SCK v1.1 (Kickstarter).
- Open the serial monitor window in the Arduino IDE (button at the top-right of the main window).
- Set the options to "115200 baud" and “No line return” (drop-down menu at the bottom-right of the monitor window).
- Wake up the module and activate the Wi-Fi command mode by typing in the serial monitor:

`$$$`

- Change to “Carriage return” option (drop-down menu at the bottom-right of the monitor window)

- Add a new SSID to memory by typing:

`set wlan ssid XXX`

Note: You have to replace XXX with your ssid name, filling any space with the dollar ($) character. Due to hardware limitations it can't be longer than 32 characters.

- Add a new phrase to memory (optional, password for WPA1 & WPA2):

`set wlan phrase XXX`

Note: You have to replace XXX with your phrase, filling any space with the dollar ($) character.

- Add a new key to memory  (optional, password for WEP & WEP64):

`set wlan key XXX`

- Add an authentication method into memory (replace XXX by “0” for Open,  “1” for WEP, “2” for WPA1, “4” for WPA2, “8” for WEP64):

`set wlan auth XXX`

- Add an antenna type into memory (replace XXX by “0” to use the internal antenna or “1” if you use an external antenna):

`set wlan ext_antenna XXX`

- Get the MAC address of the kit by typing:

`get mac`

- Copy/Save the answer for further use.

- Exit and go back to the normal operational mode by typing:

`exit`



#### STEP 2: Registering the kit in the platform

After you've uploaded your settings, don't forget to register your kit in our database by saving it's mac address. To find the mac address, you can use the serial command "get mac". Or have a look at the wifi module on the board and read the serial number under the bar code (something like "131G0006662116E4" on kit v1.0 or "0006662116E4" on kit v.1.1). 

![Find The Mac Address](img/mac_manual_sticker.jpg)

The [mac address](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address) is the last 12 digit of this serial, separated by a colon every two number. From a number like `0006662116E4` you would write `00:06:66:21:16:E4`.

In both cases, you have to fill the mac address input field in the configuration page of your kit and press the save button.

![Register The Kit](img/mac_2.png)


 
You are now done with the manual configuration of your SCK. Wait for a few minutes to see your data coming on the server and being displayed on the web page. You can also check that everything is ok by looking at the Arduino serial monitor. Debug messages coming from your SCK should look like this:

If you want to explore further options with the WiFly module check [The SCK Command Line](#/start/the-sck-command-line) section.

If you encounter any issue, please share your problem on the [forum](http://forum.smartcitizen.me/)

### Manual set up: The Compilation Way

This tutorial is aimed to advanced users, we will guide you through the process of setting up your kit by editing directly the source code. As the code is Open Source, one way of setting the Wi-Fi of your SCK is to download the latest firmware, edit some lines of code, recompile it and upload it to the kit. 
 
One advantage of this method is that it gives you the opportunity to register multiple Wi-Fi networks at the same time and make the persistent. The Wi-fi networks that you register directly in the source code are called *hardcoded* and the only way to remove them is with the same process of compiling and uploading the firmware again. This is useful if your SCK is traveling from one location to another where the Wi-Fi credentials are known.

The downside of this method is that you can not extract the MAC address of your kit, if you don't know it yet you will have to use the method described in [The Serial Way](#/start/manual-set-up-the-serial-way) or via the configurator in the setup page of your kit.


#### STEP 1: Getting the Firmware

You can download the latest firmware on our Github: 

https://github.com/fablabbcn/Smart-Citizen-Kit/releases

As you may know, the hardware and software are based on the Arduino project. We will use the Arduino IDE to edit the firmware and upload it to the kit. This tutorial have been tested with Arduino 1.6.8, please download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

Once installed open the file `Smart-Citizen-Kit/sck_beta_v0_9_0/sck_beta_v0_9.ino`

#### STEP 2: Editing the code

If you want to set the network configuration manually, you should go to the `Constants.h` tab and modify the lines you see below:
 
```	cpp
#define networks 0
#if (networks > 0)
static char* mySSID[networks]      = { 
  "SSID1"      , "SSID2"     		};
static char* myPassword[networks]  = { 
  "PASS1"      , "PASS2"			};
static char* wifiEncript[networks] = { 
  WPA2         , WPA2               };
static char* antennaExt[networks]  = { 
  INT_ANT      , INT_ANT            };
#endif      
```
 
The easiest way would be to write `"#define networks X"` (where X is the number of WI-FI networks you are going to use) and fill the options for your network:

- Add the name of your network in `SSIDX` and the corresponding password in `PASSX`. Due to hardware limitations neither the password or the ssid can't be longer tham 32 characters.
- On `wifiEncript` you could also choose the encryption mode that fits with your network's configuration (`OPEN`, `WEP`, `WPA1`, `WPA2`, `WEP64`).
- On `antennaExt` you can choose the type of antenna you are using (`INT_ANT` for internal antenna (default) or `EXT_ANT` for external antenna).
 
If you register only one wifi credential, you should obtain something like this:

```	cpp 
#define networks 1
#if (networks > 0)
char* mySSID[networks]      = { "MyWifiSSID" };
char* myPassword[networks]  = { "MyPassword" };
char* wifiEncript[networks] = { WPA2 };
char* antennaExt[networks]  = { INT_ANT };
#endif
```

*Note that if you configure more than one Wi-fi network you have to separate the variables with a comma, for example:* 
```cpp
char* mySSID[networks] = { "MyFirstSSID", "MySecondSSID" };
```


#### STEP 3: Uploading the code

![Select the board](img/arduino_board.png)

On the Arduino IDE *Tools* menu you should select the right **Board** in the *Boards* menu:

* For SmartCitizen Kit version 1.0 select *Arduino Leonardo* (ATmega 32U4 at 16Mhz) 

* For SmartCitizen Kit version 1.1 select *Arduino LilyPad USB* (ATmega 32U4 at 8Mhz)

The Arduino IDE should automatically select the right USB port but you can check it in the *Tools* >> *Port* menu.  

![Upload the firmware](img/arduino_upload_small.png)

Now you just need to click the *Upload*  button and Arduino will do the rest for you!

In case you have any issue please check the [Arduino Troubleshooting](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/troubleshooting) guide. 

#### STEP 4: Registering the kit in the platform


After you’ve uploaded your settings, don’t forget to register your kit in our database by saving it’s mac address. To find the mac address, you can use the serial command “get mac”  by following the section [The Serial Way](#/start/manual-set-up-the-serial-way). Or have a look at the wifi module on the board and read the serial number under the bar code (something like “131G0006662116E4” on kit v1.0 or “0006662116E4” on kit v.1.1).


![Find The Mac Address](img/mac_manual_sticker.jpg)

The [mac address](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address) is the last 12 digit of this serial, separated by a colon every two number. From a number like `0006662116E4` you would write `00:06:66:21:16:E4`.

In both cases, you have to fill the mac address input field in the configuration page of your kit and press the save button.

![Register The Kit](img/mac_2.png)
 
You are now done with the manual configuration of your SCK. Wait for a few minutes to see your data coming on the server and being displayed on the web page. You can also check that everything is ok by looking the output of your kit via the Arduino serial monitor.

If you encounter any issue, please share your problem on the [forum](http://forum.smartcitizen.me/)

### Attaching the solar panel

The solar panel should fulfill the specification of a voltage bigger than 8v and less than 15v, 12v is the recommended voltage, and a minimum of 500mA.

In order to attach the solar panel you have to solder the cables of the solar panel to the pads marked in the next image for version 1.0 of the SCK. For version 1.1 you have to connect the cables to the connector marked in the next image. 

In both versions, yo have to attach the plus of solar panel to the plus pad of the SCK, and the minus of the solar panel to the minus pad of the SCK.

Hardware
=====
### Inside the SCK

#### Main Board

The main board contains the basic functionality like sensor I/O to read de sensor values, communication with the platform through the wifi module, manage the power and battery charging.

![Main Board CPU](img/v1.0/main_board_cpu.jpg)
![Main Board CPU](img/main_board_cpu.jpg)

#####PINOUT

The SCK Main Board connects to the Sensor Board 16 pin connector. This is how the pins are laid out on the board. The numbers in brackets are the actual pin numbers of the micro controller. Pins IO are digital and S are analogue.


|           |           |
| --------- | --------- |
| GND       | GND       |
| IO3 (10)  | IO2 (9)   |
| IO1 (13)  | IO0 (5)   |
| SCL       | SDA       |
| S5  (A1)  | S4  (A0)  |
| S3  (A3)  | S2  (A2)  |
| S1  (A5)  | S0  (A4)  |
| VBAT      | VBAT      |


#####CPU 

Both versions of the SCK (1.0 and 1.1) are using the same CPU, ATMEGA32U4 (Arduino Leonardo). With the difference that the 1.0 works at 5V and 16MHZ and the 1.1 works at 3.3V and 8MHZ. In the 1.1 version we’ve improved the power consumption. 

This CPU has native USB and an UART TTL port allowing us to connect directly with the WIFI module.

[ATMEGA32U4 datasheet](http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-7766-8-bit-AVR-ATmega16U4-32U4_Datasheet.pdf)

#####USB CONNECTOR

The 1.0 version uses a Mini USB connector and 1.1 version uses a Micro USB.

![usb connectors](img/usb_connectors.png)



#####WIFI MODULE

The RN-131 module is a standalone, embedded wireless 802.11 b/g networking module. With its small form factor and extremely low power consumption, the RN-131 fits perfectly for the SCK wireless communication requirements.

<a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/rn-131-ds-v3.2r.pdf" target="_blank">WIFLY module - RN-131 datasheet</a>


#####BATTERY POWERING

For powering the SCK, in both versions, we are using a 3.7v 2000 mAh li-on battery. 

SCK version 1.0 uses two different voltages, 3.3V and 5V to power the IC’s. To get 5V from 3.3v we are using a step-up based on NCP1400, thus having a stable voltage at 5v and 100mA. On the other hand, to regulate the voltage and to obtain 3.3v, the SCK uses the IC MAX604.

![NCP1400](img/v1.0/main_board_NCP1400.jpg)
![MAX604](img/v1.0/main_board_MAX604.jpg)

[NCP1400 datasheet](http://www.onsemi.com/pub_link/Collateral/NCP1400A-D.PDF)  
[MAX604 datasheet](http://www.solarbotics.net/library/datasheets/MAX604.pdf)  

In 1.1 version, to make things simpler, the voltage of entire SCK was unified to 3.3V. The responsible to regulate the voltage from 3.7v to 3.3v is the MCP1725 IC.

![MCP1725](img/main_board_MCP1725.jpg)

[MCP1725 datasheet](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/22026b.pdf)  


#####BATTERY CHARGING

For charging the battery there are two ways, USB or solar panel. To carry out the charging we are using MCP73831 IC. 

For charging the battery in 1.0 version the solar panel have to be 12v and 500mA. In 1.1 version, the solar panel can be more versatile in terms of amperage. 

![MCP73831](img/v1.0/main_board_MCP73831.jpg)

[MCP73831 datasheet](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/20001984g.pdf)


#####SOLAR PANEL CHARGING

Depending on the sunlight conditions the solar panel produces up to 12v, we have to reduce the voltage to 5v to feed up the Vin of the MCP73831 charger IC. 

To carry out this task we are using the LM2674 IC, a very efficient IC, with a rate of 91% of performance.

![LM2674](img/v1.0/main_board_LM2674.jpg)
![LM2674](img/main_board_LM2674.jpg)

[LM2674 datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm2674.pdf)


#####RTC (REAL TIME CLOCK)

The SCK has a real time clock for keeping track of time when the kit is offline. For this task we chose the DS1307 IC for the 1.0 version and the DS1339Y-3+ IC for the 1.1 version. Different IC due to the different voltages, 5V for the 1.0 version and 3.3V for the 1.1 version.

#####SD CARD READER

The SD card is used to store the data captured by the sensors when the kit is offline. When the kit gets connected, the data will be reeded from the SD card and uploaded to the platform. 

To hold the SD card we are using the DM3CS holder. The SD card is powered at 3.3V and communicates with the CPU through SPI protocol.

#####EEPROM MEMORY

For the users that don’t have a SD card we’ve added an EEPROM memory to store the data when the SCK is offline. We chose the 24LC256 IC that can store 32kBytes, it communicates with the CPU through I2C protocol.

![24LC256](img/v1.0/main_board_24LC256.jpg)

#####MAIN BOARD BASIC SENSORS

The main board has some basic sensors:

- Measurement of the battery level
- Measurement of the solar panel level
- Measurement of the wireless networks detected


#### SENSOR BOARD

The sensor board contains the necessary sensors for measuring all the other parameters. This means NO2 and CO gases, sunlight, noise pollution, temperature, humidity. Also, the sensor board has an I2C bus, this allows to expand the SCK to other kind of sensors.

![Sensor Board](img/v1.0/sensor_board.jpg)

#####NO2 AND CO SENSORS

To measure these two gases we chose <a href="http://www.e2v.com/" target="_blank">e2v</a> sensors. In particular, metal oxide sensors MICS5525 and MICS2710, for version 1.0. And MICS4514, for version 1.1, that contains both sensors in one.

Metal oxide sensors are based on oxide semiconductors. Their electrical conductivity is modulated due to the reaction between the semiconductor and the gases in the atmosphere.

#####LIGHT SENSOR

The light sensor is a basic element to know the light pollution. In version 1.0, was used a LDR (light-dependent resistor) whose voltage varies depending on the light conditions.

For version 1.1, was used a photodiode BH1730FVC. This sensor contains an I2C bus that gives us directly the amount of lux of ambient and infrared light.

#####NOISE SENSOR

The noise sensor is based on an electret microphone. For the version 1.0 WM-61A was used as the microphone, the captured audio signal is passed through an operational amplifier configured as band pass filter.

![Noise Sensor](img/v1.0/sensor_board_noise_sensor.jpg)

For the version 1.1 POM-3044P-R was used.

#####TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY SENSOR

To measure temperature and humidity a module that integrates both sensors was used. 

For version 1.0 the RHT22 was used, it has *one wire* digital interface.

![RHT22 Sensor](img/v1.0/sensor_board_RHT22.jpg)

For version 1.1 the SHT21 was used, it has *I2C* protocol and faster response between measures than the RHT22.

#####3 AXIS ACCELEROMETER

In version 1.0 we detected that some measures vary depending on the orientation of the SCK. 

That's why in version 1.1 we added the ADXL345 accelerometer to detect the position and to compensate the measures depending on the orientation of 
the SCK. This accelerometer communicates via I2C protocol with the kit.

#####I2C EXPANSION BUS

Due to the ease of the I2C protocol. We’ve included and I2C bus to provide to the community the opportunity of expanding the SCK.

### Inside the SC Platform

Once you've added your SCK to the platform and it's capturing and sending data correctly, you can interact with the platform in several ways. Visualizing the data, downloading the data and interacting with the data through the API.

**Data Visualization**

To visualize the data of your device, you have to sign in into the platform. Once you've signed, you'll be in your dashboard, click on SENSORS tab, click on one of your sensors and click in the button SHOW IN MAP.

Now, at bottom of your browser will appear a panel for visualize your data. You can visualize one by one or multiple together. For this, you can switch between the different sensors data clicking on the icons under the label FILTER. Also, you can change between different periods of time, selecting HOUR, DAY, WEEK... in the SHOW LAST drop-down selector.

**Download Data**

If you are interested in use the data captured by your sensors, you can download all the data for later use. To do this, go to your sensor profile, at the bottom there is a selector under the label DOWNLOAD DATA. You can choose between 3 different formats, CSV, XML and JSON.

**API**

The <a href="http://developer.smartcitizen.me/" target="_blank">Smart Citizen API</a> allows you to request back information from your devices and do incredible things with it.

It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">REST</a> API and it returns the information in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json" target="_blank">JSON</a> format. This means you can easily access the information from any language like Javascript, PHP, Processing.org, Python, and start doing things with it quickly.

### How do I register again my SCK?

It is really important to understand a SCK can be just registered one time to one device in the platform. 

_Imagine how confusing it will be a single physical device publishing as two separate kits on the platform in two different locations!_

That's why you will need to *unlink* your SCK before you can register it again as another kit or when you would like to give your device to someone else to use it.

Go to your Kits profile [page](https://smartcitizen.me/profile/kits) select the kit you will like to unlink and go to **Setup**. You don't need to connect your SCK, just scroll down, remove the Mad Address number from the field and click **Save**.

_This way your kit will keep all the data on the platform but you will be able to register your SCK again as another kit. You can alway register again your SCK on the same device by following the standard setup process._


### Is my home wireless internet going to work with the SCK?

The Smart Citizen Kit is designed to work with most home and office standard Wi-Fi routers and access points. However we do not support network names or passwords longer than *19 characters* or with a `$` character.

We also do not support **WPA Enterprise** networks or **Captive portal** log in as the ones on some big companies and airports. We suggest you contact your IT support team, they can enable you special access in the network based on your device **Mac Address**. 

### How to use the SD Card?

1. **microSD**: We recommend formatting **micro SD** cards using the official SD tool you can download [here](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/).

2. **RTC**: Place a **CR1220** cell battery on your kit. Before uploading the SD firmware use the on-line configuration tool at [smartcitizen.me](https://smartcitizen.me) to set your Wi-Fi credentials. Turn your kit off and on for a minute, the blue led's will blink and your kit will connect to the internet and sync its the internal clock with our remote servers. Once the time is set the cell battery will keep SCK time in sync for more than 4 years.

3. You can now install the <a href="https://github.com/fablabbcn/Smart-Citizen-Kit/tree/master/sck_beta_v0_8_7_SDCARD" target="_blank">**SD firmware**</a> using the [Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). 

**Dependencies:**

* In order to compile and upload the firmware you will need to install the **SdFat** library for Arduino.

* Download the library [here](https://github.com/greiman/SdFat) and install the library following the [instructions](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries).

**Boards:**

* For SmartCitizen Kit version 1.0 select `Tools/Boards/Arduino Leonardo` on the Arduino IDE (ATmega 32U4 at 16Mhz) 

* For SmartCitizen Kit version 1.1 select `Tools/Boards/Lylipad Arduino USB` on the Arduino IDE (ATmega 32U4 at 8Mhz) 

**SD data format**

When using the **SD firmware** on the SCK, data is stored as **CSV** ([comma separated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)) file on the SD card.

This is an example of the output file once opened on a spreadsheet application:

| Temperature | Humidity | Light   | Battery | Solar Panel | CO     | NO2  | Noise | UTC                 |
|-------------|----------|---------|---------|-------------|--------|------|-------|---------------------|
| 2821.20     | 4072.00  | 4413.10 | 96.40   | 0.00        | 94.67  | 0.65 | 5.23  | 2000-01-01 00:00:02 |
| 2784.40     | 4236.80  | 5936.70 | 96.10   | 0.00        | 278.27 | 1.05 | 2.39  | 2000-01-01 00:00:02 |

**Data Conversions**

The data stored is automatically converted to the proper units in firmware.

If you prefer to do the conversions manually set `DataRaw       false` in the `Constants.h` file and apply the formulas on the following table:

| ID | Sensor      | Units    | Conversion Formula                            |
|----|-------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 0  | Temperature | ºC       | T = -53 + 175.72 / 65536.0 * ( Traw * 10 )    |
| 1  | Humidity    | %Rel     | H = 7 + 125.0 / 65536.0 * ( Hraw * 10 )       |
| 2  | Light       | Lux      | L = Lraw / 10                                 |
| 3  | Battery     | %        | Not required                                  |
| 4  | Panel       | mV       | Not required                                  |
| 5  | CO          | kOhm     | Not required                                  |
| 6  | NO2         | kOhm     | Not required                                  |
| 7  | Noise       | dB       | Apply the conversion table from mV to dB: [CSV](https://gist.github.com/pral2a/d767cc45874361fd38bf)       |
| 8  | Date        | DD:MM:YY | Not required                                  |
| 9  | Time        | hh:mm:ss | Not required                                  |


### How to import the SD card data?

**Sorry, this is temporary disabled! We are working on a new release.**

You can import the recorded data in to [smartcitizen.me](http://smartcitizen.me)

In your device page you will find the **Import SD** along with the Edit and Configure options.

Using a microSD card reader get the **post.csv** file from your card, select it and click import. Data will be imported in to your device, data existing on the file already imported will be skipped. Your kit should be running the latest SD firmware  and the SCK time (RTC) should be set in order data can be imported.

### Is my kit publishing data properly?

**Sorry, this is temporary disabled! We are working on a new release.**

You can easily check each time your kit is publishing data to our platform in real time by enabling the debug mode on your device.

* Go to your device edit page in [smartcitizen.me](http://smartcitizen.me), set Debug Enabled and save it.
* Visit [data.smartcitizen.me/debug](http://data.smartcitizen.me/debug) you will see the data from all the devices on debug mode every time they publish in real time. You can identify your device by the device id. **Note data comes uncalibrated.*

![image](img/data_debug.png)

### How to retrieve other kit's data?

Current [API](http://developer.smartcitizen.me/) allows you full access to all the Smart Citizen Platform. Please, ask in the [forum](http://forum.smartcitizen.me/) or contact [support@smartcitizen.me](mailto:support@smartcitizen.me) for any questions regarding the API.

### How to store data in your own database?

**Kit's request**

The Smart Citizen Kit is publishing by default the data as a PUT Http request, the sensor data is encoded as JSON.

Here you can see how a kit's request will look like *(Note the request is not standard as it do not contains a payload)*:

``` shell
PUT /add HTTP/1.1
Host: data.smartcitizen.me
User-Agent: SmartCitizen
X-SmartCitizenMacADDR: 00:00:00:00:00:00
X-SmartCitizenVersion: 1.1-0.8.5-A
X-SmartCitizenData: [{"temp":"29090.6", "hum":"6815.74", "light":"30000", "bat":"786", "panel":"0", "co":"112500", "no2":"200000", "noise":"2", "nets":"10", "timestamp":"2013-10-28 1:34:26"}]
```

Here you have a kit's request as a  **Curl** for test purposes:

``` shell
$ curl -X PUT -H 'Host: data.smartcitizen.me' -H 'User-Agent: SmartCitizen' -H 'X-SmartCitizenMacADDR: 00:00:00:00:00:00' -H 'X-SmartCitizenVersion: 1.1-0.8.5-A' -H 'X-SmartCitizenData: [{"temp":"29090.6", "hum":"6815.74", "light":"30000", "bat":"786", "panel":"0", "co":"112500", "no2":"200000", "noise":"2", "nets":"10", "timestamp":"2013-10-28 1:34:26"}]' data.smartcitizen.me/add
```

**Data processing**

Values are send without the proper scaling and some sensors as temperature, humidity and noise are sent in raw and then calibrated in our platform. This are the conversion required for **SCK 1.1** and above.

| Key       | Sensor      | Units               | Conversion formula                            | Conversion Method                         |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| temp      | Temperature | ºC                  | T = -53 + 175.72 / 65536.0 * Traw             | SCKSensorData::tempConversion($rawTemp)   |
| hum       | Humidity    | %Rel                | H = 7 + 125.0 / 65536.0 * Hraw                | SCKSensorData::humConversion($rawHum)     |
| light     | Light       | Lux                 | L = Lraw / 10                                 | SCKSensorData::lightConversion($rawLight) |
| noise     | Noise       | dB                  | Apply the conversion table from mV to dB: [CSV](https://gist.github.com/pral2a/d767cc45874361fd38bf) | SCKSensorData::noiseConversion($rawNoise) |
| co        | CO          | kOhm                | CO = COraw / 10000                            | SCKSensorData::coConversion($rawCO)       |
| no2       | NO2         | kOhm                | NO2 = NO2raw / 10000                          | SCKSensorData::no2Conversion($rawNO2)     |
| bat       | Battery     | %                   | B = Braw / 10                                 | SCKSensorData::batConversion($rawBat)     |
| panel     | Panel       | mV                  | P = Praw / 10000                              | SCKSensorData::panelConversion($rawPanel) |
| nets      | Nets        | Wi-Fi Networks      | Not required                                  | Not required                              |
| timestamp | Timestamp   | YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss | Not required                                  | Not required                              |

You can use the **[SCKSensorData](https://github.com/fablabbcn/Smart-Citizen-Kit/blob/master/data/) php** class to re-scale and calibrate the received data. Check it on [github](https://github.com/fablabbcn/Smart-Citizen-Kit/blob/master/data/).

Here is an example how to use it to receive a request, converted and store it in a CSV file:

``` php
<?php
	include('../sck_sensor_data.php');

	$headers = getallheaders();

	$data = $headers['X-SmartCitizenData'];

	$datapoints = json_decode($data, true);

	foreach ($datapoints as $datapoint) {
	$datapoint = SCKSensorData::SCK11Convert($datapoint);
		$csv .= implode(', ', $datapoint);
	}

	$csv .= PHP_EOL;

	file_put_contents('./data.csv', $csv, FILE_APPEND);
?>
```

You can find the complete example [here](https://github.com/fablabbcn/Smart-Citizen-Kit/blob/master/data/examples/add.php).

Each sensor is implemented as a separate function and some general methods are available for simplifying the work. Here is an example:

``` php
<?php

	/**
	 * noiseCalibration
	 *
	 * Noise calibration for SCK1.1 sound sensor. Converts mV in to dBs. 
	 * Based on a linear regression from a lookup table (db.json) 
	 * obtained after real measurements from our test facility.
	 * 
	 *
	 * @param float $rawSound
	 * @return float noise as sound pressure in dB
	 *
	 */
	
	public function noiseCalibration($rawSound)
	{
		$dbTable = json_decode(file_get_contents("db.json"), true);
		return round(self::tableCalibration($dbTable, $rawSound), 2);
	}
?>
```
**How to proceed**

Here are the different paths you can take in order to built your own backend:

- Create a fork of the the <a href="https://github.com/fablabbcn/Smart-Citizen-Kit/tree/master" target="_blank">Smart Citizen Kit firmware</a> in order to send the data as your custom backend expect it.

- Create your own custom backend. We can share all the different modules of our backend in order for you to receive data as on the curl example above, calibrate it and store it. Contact us at <a href="mailto:support@smartcitizen.me">support@smartcitizen.me</a>.

- Keep using our backend but request our API <a href="http://developer.smartcitizen.me/" target="_blank">developer.smartcitizen.me</a> and then fill database choosen with it.


### How to install the drivers on Windows?

In Windows you will need to install the Arduino Drivers if you haven't done it before.

#### Windows 8, 7, Vista, and XP

*   Go to the Arduino [download page](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and download the latest version of the Arduino software for Windows.
*   When the download is finished, un-zip it and open up the Arduino folder to confirm that yes, there are indeed some files and sub-folders inside. The file structure is important so don’t be moving any files around unless you really know what you’re doing.
*   Power up your Smart Citizen Kit by connecting it to your computer with a USB cable. You should see the green LED near the on/off switch light up.
*   If you’re running Windows 8, you’ll need to disable driver signing, so go see the Windows 8 section. If you’re running Windows 7, Vista, or XP, you’ll need to install some drivers, so head to the Windows 7, Vista, and XP section down below.

#### Windows 8

Windows 8 comes with a nice little security ‘feature’ that ‘protects’ you from unsigned driver installation. The Smart Citizen Kit driver is not signed so you’ll have to tell Windows to disable driver signing. This issue has been addressed in newer releases of the Arduino IDE, but if you run into issues, you can try this fix first.

For a nice, step-by-step tutorial with pictures [click here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/disabling-driver-signature-on-windows-8/overview), otherwise the steps are outlined below.

To _temporarily_ disable driver signing:

*   From the Metro Start Screen, open Settings (move your mouse to the bottom-right-corner of the screen and wait for the pop-out bar to appear, then click the Gear icon)
*   Click ‘More PC Settings’
*   Click ‘General’
*   Scroll down, and click ‘Restart now’ under ‘Advanced startup’.
*   Wait a bit.
*   Click ‘Troubleshoot’.
*   Click ‘Advanced Options’
*   Click ‘Windows Startup Settings’
*   Click Restart.
*   When your computer restarts, select ‘Disable driver signature enforcement‘ from the list.

To _permanently_ disable driver signing (recommended, but has some minor security implications):

*   Go to the metro start screen
*   Type in “cmd”
*   Right click “Command Prompt” and select “Run as Administrator” from the buttons on the bottom of your screen
*   Type/paste in the following commands: bcdedit -set loadoptions DISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS bcdedit -set TESTSIGNING ON
*   Reboot!

#### Windows 7, Vista, and XP

Installing the Drivers for the Arduino Uno (from Arduino.cc)

*   Plug in your board and wait for Windows to begin it’s driver installation process
*   After a few moments, the process will fail, despite its best efforts
*   Click on the Start Menu, and open up the Control Panel
*   While in the Control Panel, navigate to System and Security. Next, click on System
*   Once the System window is up, open the Device Manager
*   Look under Ports (COM & LPT). You should see an open port named “Arduino UNO (COMxx)”. If there is no COM & LPT section, look under ‘Other Devices’ for ‘Unknown Device’

[![alt text](img/windows_driver_1.png)](img/windows_driver_1.png)

*   Right click on the “Arduino UNO (COMxx)” or “Unknown Device” port and choose the “Update Driver Software” option
*   Next, choose the “Browse my computer for Driver software” option

[![alt text](img/windows_driver_2.png)](img/windows_driver_2.png)

*   Finally, navigate to and select the Uno’s driver file, named “ArduinoUNO.inf”, located in the “Drivers” folder of the Arduino Software download (not the “FTDI USB Drivers” sub-directory). If you cannot see the .inf file, it is probably just hidden. You can select the ‘drivers’ folder with the ‘search sub-folders’ option selected instead.
*   Windows will finish up the driver installation from there

### Which LiPo batteries to use?

The battery that we are providing is 3.7v and 2000mAh

### Which solar panels to use?

The solar panel it should fulfill the specification of a voltage bigger than 8v and less than 15v, 12v is the recommended voltage, and a minimum of 500mA.

### How I can extend the Wi-Fi range?

Is your SCK quite far away from Wi-Fi access point? You can use an external antenna with your SCK. 

The Wi-Fi modules has a U.FL antenna connector. We recommend you to use a [U.FL to RP-SMA adaptor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/662) in order to use [standard Wi-Fi antennas](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/558). You then will need to enable the *External Antenna* on the [Wi-Fi setup process](http://docs.smartcitizen.me/#/start/adding-a-smart-citizen-kit) by selecting _External Antenna_. 
 
### What is the spec (battery type) for the button-cell for the RTC?

The RTC battery is a CR1220

### Why is 50dB the microphone lowest value?

Because the actual sensor is limited by the curve bounding from 50dB to 103dB

### Browsers compatibility

The SmartCitizen platform is built using the latest Web technologies (such as HTML5, SVG and CSS3). These languages serve as a foundation for today’s websites and web applications. 

To enjoy Smart Citizen, we recommend you to use:

Google Chrome 25+
Firefox Mozilla 20+

For the kit setup process only Google Chrome is supported.

### What are the LEDs for, and what does the LED blinking mean?

There are 5 LEDs, they are all on the base half of the SCK.  They can be understood in three groups:

 - LED2 and LED1 - These are the two yellow (or orange) LEDs in the lower center-left of the board.  You will only see these lit when your USB cable is connected to the SCK and you are configuring or otherwise interacting with the SCK.  LED2 is the "RX USB" and will be lit when the SCK is receiving information via the USB connection. LED1 is the "TX USB" and will be lit when the SCK is sending information via the USB connection.   

 - LED4 and LED3 - These are the two blue LEDs in the lower center of the board.  You will see these blink often. LED3 is the "WiFi Association" and LED4 is the "WiFi Connection." The blue LEDs will blink each time the SCK posts new data wirelessly. This is normal behavior and is expected, but it only happens in bursts (then there will be no blue LED lit for about 30-40 seconds). If your blue LEDs are blinking back and forth non-stop, this means your SCK has lost its WiFi connection. Check to make sure your router is still on, and that you're still in range of it.

 - LED5 - This is the green LED in the upper left corner.  It will be lit when the SCK is turned on and has power.

Troubleshooting
====

### Add an SSID with two words

If your SSID has more than one word yo have to fill any space with the dollar ($) character.

### Serial port already in use

This happens when one application is already using the serial port. For example, if you have the Arduino IDE serial monitor opened and you're trying to configure your SCK through the web browser. You have yo close the serial monitor first.

### No port available

This message will appear when you have uploaded the wrong firmware version to your SCK.

### Unable to connect to the Board

This happens when one application is already using the serial port. For example, if you have the Arduino IDE serial monitor opened and you're trying to configure your SCK through the web browser. You have yo close the serial monitor first.

### Unable to connect to the Internet

If you're getting the message "Error in connection" when you run the SCK firmware this may be due:

- Your router works with a protocol different than 802.11AG
- You have set wrong SSID name and/or password 
- Your network has an encryption different than OPEN, WEP, WPA1, WPA2 OR WEP64
- Your firewall is blocking the mac address of your SCK
- Your internet connection is not stable

### No data received yet

This message appears the first time you register your kit, is due to cache issues. This issue normally is fixed after a few hours, in any case we are working to improve this issue.

### Port is not appearing on the drop down

This may be due:

- The SCK is turned off.
- The USB cable you're using has wired only power cable and not the data cables.
- The bootloader is corrupted.

### Firmware update problem

If you're having problems updating the firmware you can try one of these two options:

- Update the latest firmware through the web browser configurator.
- Update the latest firmware through Arduino IDE.

If you're still having problems it's may be due to a hardware or software issue, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@smartcitizen.me">support@smartcitizen.me</a>.

#### No MAC address registered

If you're getting this message, the may be due:

- Configuration process is not finished correctly.
- The WIFI module of your SCK is corrupted, so MAC address is not accessible. To repair your wifi module refer to this <a href="" target="_blank">tutorial</a>.

### Collapsed USB port

First batches of SCK version 1.1 came with this issue. We have a tutorial you can follow to repair it or contact us at <a href="mailto:support@smartcitizen.me" target="_blank">support@smartcitizen.me</a>.

### Broken LiPo battery wire

Depending on the conditions, the battery wires can suffer until its break. We encourage you to read this <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/241" target="_blank">Battery Common Care Techniques</a> in order to preserve your battery.

### Non-Stop Blue LED Blinking

If your blue LEDs are blinking back and forth non-stop, this means your SCK has lost its WiFi connection. Check to make sure your router is still on, and that you're still in range.
